Analyzing FIFA Player Performance and Trends

## Overview

This project conducts a detailed clustering analysis of FIFA player attributes to segment players into distinct groups based on their performance scores. By leveraging a single year's dataset, we aim to identify patterns and categorize players, facilitating targeted insights for teams, managers, and gaming enthusiasts to strategize player selection and team building.

## Data Source

Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset detailing FIFA player attributes, including performance scores, physical attributes, and skill ratings. This dataset serves as the cornerstone for our clustering analysis.

## Key Findings

Successfully clustered FIFA players into distinct groups, revealing unique patterns in player attributes and performance scores.
Visualized clustering outcomes to demonstrate the characteristics and similarities within each player segment.
Identified key attributes that distinguish high-performing players from others, offering insights for talent identification and team optimization.

## Future Work

Future directions include exploring additional clustering algorithms to refine player segmentation further and incorporating player performance data from subsequent seasons to validate and enhance the clustering model's robustness.
